 * Cold-start connect budgets shared by Electron main and the renderer.

 * Main waits `DEFAULT_PORT_ANNOUNCE_TIMEOUT_MS` for `HERMES_BACKEND_READY` /
 * `HERMES_DASHBOARD_READY` before it gives up on a still-starting child. The
 * renderer `getConnection()` IPC used to expire at 45s, so a slow Windows
 * cold start failed the boot overlay while main was still waiting and the
 * backend then came up healthy.
 *
 * Both sides read this module so those deadlines cannot drift. The renderer
 * wait covers the announce deadline plus the health poll after it and stays
 * finite: a dead child rejects the IPC when it exits or when a deadline
 * passes, and a wedged round-trip still ends. This is one wait, not a retry
 * interval.
