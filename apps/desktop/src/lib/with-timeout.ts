/** Budget for the renderer awaits that can be waiting on a backend cold
 * spawn's whole chain — boot-class callers only. Three sites, all named
 * here so a new caller must decide which class it is:
 *   1. initial boot()'s getConnection() (use-gateway-boot.ts) — the primary
 *      cold spawn this is sized for;
 *   2. a profile/connection switch whose ensureBackend may cold-spawn a
 *      pooled helper (use-gateway-boot.ts) — same chain;
 *   3. the registry restore's descriptor wait (connections.ts) — resolves
 *      only when boot() publishes, so it is a parallel view of site 1.
 *
 * Sized by main's cold-start chain (desktop-boot-budget.ts): port announce,
 * health poll, and a margin for the work around them, so the IPC is still
 * in flight when a slow but healthy backend publishes. The accepted cost: a
 * wedged main-process round-trip at boot also takes this long to surface the
 * recovery overlay — the same trade main made raising the readiness poll to
 * 180s (#63454). The bound stays finite, so it ends.
 *
 * Main answers the announce deadline it resolved
 * (HERMES_DESKTOP_PORT_ANNOUNCE_TIMEOUT_MS included) through preload before
 * this module loads, so an override stretches both sides. The
 * undefined-window case (SSR, tests without a bridge) falls back to the
 * default deadline; the packaged app always reads the value main resolved.
 * Awaits against an already-spawned backend are reconnect-class and use
 * the shorter RECONNECT_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_MS below instead. */
